 * Medium (45.51%)
 * Total Accepted:    53.8K
 * Total Submissions: 118.2K
 * Testcase Example:  '[-2,0,1,3]\n2'
 *
 * Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index
 * triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i]
 * + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
 * Output: 2 
 * Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than
 * 2:
 * [-2,0,1]
 * ⁠            [-2,0,3]
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?
