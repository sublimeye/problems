 *
 * Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in
 * the BST that are closest to the target.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Given target value is a floating point.
 * You may assume k is always valid, that is: k ≤ total nodes.
 * You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that
 * are closest to the target.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and k = 2
 * 
 * ⁠   4
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   5
 * ⁠/ \
 * 1   3
 * 
 * Output: [4,3]
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n)
 * runtime (where n = total nodes)?
