 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three
 * colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain
 * color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two
 * adjacent houses have the same color.
 * 
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x
 * 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with
 * color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and
 * so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 * 
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house
 * 2 into blue. 
 * Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
