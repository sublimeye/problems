 *
 * You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis
 * and integers. 
 * 
 * The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by
 * zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's
 * value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same
 * structure. 
 * 
 * You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it
 * exists.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
 * Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
 * 
 * ⁠      4
 * ⁠    /   \
 * ⁠   2     6
 * ⁠  / \   / 
 * ⁠ 3   1 5   
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * There will only be '(',  ')',  '-' and  '0' ~ '9' in the input string.
 * An empty tree is represented by "" instead of "()".
