 *
 * 
 * In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements
 * of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * There's originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in
 * ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can
 * generate.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod
 * 109 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1]
 * and [3,1,2].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * n is in the range of [1, 106].
