 * algorithms
 * Easy (50.78%)
 * Total Accepted:    4.3K
 * Total Submissions: 8.5K
 * Testcase Example:  '5'
 *
 * Return the number of permutations of 1 to n so that prime numbers are at
 * prime indices (1-indexed.)
 * 
 * (Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and
 * cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than
 * it.)
 * 
 * Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1]
 * is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 100
 * Output: 682289015
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 *
