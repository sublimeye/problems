 * Testcase Example:  '"abcd"'
 *
 * Given a string S, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s).
 * Return 0 if no repeating substring exists.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abcd"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no repeating substring.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *

 * Input: "abbaba"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest repeating substrings are "ab" and "ba", each of
 * which occurs twice.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "aabcaabdaab"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aab", which occurs 3
 * times.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "aaaaa"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aaaa", which occurs
 * twice.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The string S consists of only lowercase English letters from 'a' - 'z'.
 * 1 <= S.length <= 1500
