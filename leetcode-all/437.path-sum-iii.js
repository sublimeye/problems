 *
 * You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
 * 
 * Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.
 * 
 * The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go
 * downwards
 * (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
 * 
 * The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range
 * -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8
 * 
 * ⁠     10
 * ⁠    /  \
 * ⁠   5   -3
 * ⁠  / \    \
 * ⁠ 3   2   11
 * ⁠/ \   \
 * 3  -2   1
 * 
 * Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:
 * 
 * 1.  5 -> 3
 * 2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
 * 3. -3 -> 11
 *
