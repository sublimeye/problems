 * Testcase Example:  '[8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]'
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there
 * exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an
 * ancestor of B.
 * 
 * (A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or
 * any child of A is an ancestor of B.)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: 
 * We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
 * |8 - 3| = 5
 * |3 - 7| = 4
 * |8 - 1| = 7
 * |10 - 13| = 3
 * Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 -
 * 1| = 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
 * Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.
