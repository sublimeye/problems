 * Let's say a positive integer is a superpalindrome if it is a palindrome, and
 * it is also the square of a palindrome.
 * 
 * Now, given two positive integers L and R (represented as strings), return
 * the number of superpalindromes in the inclusive range [L, R].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: L = "4", R = "1000"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
 * Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a
 * palindrome.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= len(L) <= 18
 * 1 <= len(R) <= 18
 * L and R are strings representing integers in the range [1, 10^18).
 * int(L) <= int(R)
 * 
 * 
 *
