 *
 * Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if
 * you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence
 * consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
 * 1, 2, 3
 * 3, 4, 5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 * 3, 4, 5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
 * Output: False
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10000
 *
