 * Testcase Example:  '"rabbbit"\n"rabbit"'
 *
 * Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences
 * of S which equals T.
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original
 * string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing
 * the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a
 * subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
 * (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

 * rabbbit
 * ^^ ^^^^
 * rabbbit

 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
