 *
 * On a horizontal number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0],
 * stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where N = stations.length.
 * 
 * Now, we add K more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between
 * adjacent gas stations, is minimized.
 * 
 * Return the smallest possible value of D.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], K = 9
 * Output: 0.500000
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * stations.length will be an integer in range [10, 2000].
 * stations[i] will be an integer in range [0, 10^8].
 * K will be an integer in range [1, 10^6].
 * Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
