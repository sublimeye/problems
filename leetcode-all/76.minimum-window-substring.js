 * Testcase Example:  '"ADOBECODEBANC"\n"ABC"'
 *
 * Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will
 * contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the
 * empty string "".
 * If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only
 * one unique minimum window in S.
