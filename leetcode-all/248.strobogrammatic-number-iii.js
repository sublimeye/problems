 *
 * A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180
 * degrees (looked at upside down).
 * 
 * Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in
 * the range of low <= num <= high.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: low = "50", high = "100"
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
 * 
 * Note:
 * Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are
 * represented as string.
