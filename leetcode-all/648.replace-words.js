 * In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some
 * other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor.
 * For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word
 * another.
 * 
 * Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to
 * replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a
 * successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the
 * shortest length.
 * 
 * You need to output the sentence after the replacement.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
 * sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
 * Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The input will only have lower-case letters.
 * 1 <= dict words number <= 1000
 * 1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
 * 1 <= root length <= 100
 * 1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
