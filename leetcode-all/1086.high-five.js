 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]'
 *
 * Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of
 * each student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.
 * 
 * Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the
 * student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer
 * division.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
 * Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
 * Explanation: 
 * The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
 * The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division
 * their average converts to 88.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= items.length <= 1000
 * items[i].length == 2
 * The IDs of the students is between 1 to 1000
 * The score of the students is between 1 to 100
 * For each student, there are at least 5 scores
