 *
 * 
 * Given a set of keywords words and a string S, make all appearances of all
 * keywords in S bold.  Any letters between <b> and </b> tags become bold.
 * 
 * The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of
 * course the tags should form a valid combination.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, given that words = ["ab", "bc"] and  S = "aabcd", we should
 * return "a<b>abc</b>d".  Note that returning "a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d" would use
 * more tags, so it is incorrect.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * words has length in range [0, 50].
 * words[i] has length in range [1, 10].
 * S has length in range [0, 500].
 * All characters in words[i] and S are lowercase letters.
