 * Testcase Example:  '"++++"'
 *
 * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string
 * that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take
 * turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person
 * can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the
 * winner.
 * 
 * Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one
 * valid move.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "++++"
 * Output: 
 * [
 * ⁠ "--++",
 * ⁠ "+--+",
 * ⁠ "++--"
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * Note: If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].
