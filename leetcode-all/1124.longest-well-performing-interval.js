 * Testcase Example:  '[9,9,6,0,6,6,9]'
 *
 * We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given
 * employee.
 * 
 * A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours
 * worked is (strictly) greater than 8.
 * 
 * A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of
 * tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.
 * 
 * Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= hours.length <= 10000
 * 0 <= hours[i] <= 16
