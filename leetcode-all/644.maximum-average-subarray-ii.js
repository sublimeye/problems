 *
 * 
 * Given an array consisting of n integers, find the contiguous subarray whose
 * length is greater than or equal to k that has the maximum average value. And
 * you need to output the maximum average value.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
 * Output: 12.75
 * Explanation:
 * when length is 5, maximum average value is 10.8,
 * when length is 6, maximum average value is 9.16667.
 * Thus return 12.75.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 1 k n 
 * Elements of the given array will be in range [-10,000, 10,000].
 * The answer with the calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.
