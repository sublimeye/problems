 * In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a
 * /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous
 * regions.
 * 
 * (Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as
 * "\\".)
 * 
 * Return the number of regions.

 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
 * grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
