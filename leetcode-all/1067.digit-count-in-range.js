 * Testcase Example:  '1\n1\n13'
 *
 * Given an integer d between 0 and 9, and two positive integers low and high
 * as lower and upper bounds, respectively. Return the number of times that d
 * occurs as a digit in all integers between low and high, including the bounds
 * low and high.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 
 * The digit d=1 occurs 6 times in 1,10,11,12,13. Note that the digit d=1
 * occurs twice in the number 11.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: d = 3, low = 100, high = 250
 * Output: 35
 * Explanation: 
 * The digit d=3 occurs 35 times in 103,113,123,130,131,...,238,239,243.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= d <= 9
 * 1 <= low <= high <= 2Ã—10^8
