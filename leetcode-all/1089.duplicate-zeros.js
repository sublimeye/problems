 * Testcase Example:  '[1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]'
 *
 * Given a fixed lengthÂ array arr of integers, duplicate each occurrence of
 * zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.
 * 
 * Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.
 * 
 * Do the above modifications to the input array in place, do not return
 * anything from your function.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
 * Output: null
 * Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to:
 * [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3]
 * Output: null
 * Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to:
 * [1,2,3]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 10000
 * 0 <= arr[i] <= 9
