 *
 * Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each
 * unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to
 * trap after raining.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * Both m and n are less than 110. The height of each unit cell is greater than
 * 0 and is less than 20,000.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Given the following 3x6 height map:
 * [
 * ⁠ [1,4,3,1,3,2],
 * ⁠ [3,2,1,3,2,4],
 * ⁠ [2,3,3,2,3,1]
 * ]
 * 
 * Return 4.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The above image represents the elevation map
 * [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]] before the rain.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of
 * water trapped is 4.
